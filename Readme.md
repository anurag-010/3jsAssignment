# React Three.js Experience

This project demonstrates a basic setup for creating a 3D experience using React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei, and Jotai for state management.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, you can use the following npm script:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server and open the project in your default web browser.

## How to Use

- Once the project is running, you will see a 3D scene rendered in the browser.
- You can interact with the scene using your mouse or touchpad to rotate the camera.
- Clicking the "ENTER" button will navigate to the store page within the 3D scene.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/Experience.js`: Main component containing the 3D scene setup.
- `src/components/Home.js`: Component containing non-3D content and navigation.
- `src/components/SwampIsland.js`: Component representing a swamp island in the 3D scene.
- `src/App.js`: Main entry point of the application.
- `public/index.html`: HTML template for the application.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your development environment supports ES6 syntax and JSX.
- You may need to configure your IDE with appropriate syntax highlighting and linting extensions for JavaScript and JSX files.
